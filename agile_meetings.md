# Agile Process

## Overview

For ACG, we will be following a Agile meeting methodology.  An overview of Agile meetings can be found [here](https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/Agile_Meetings_Goals_and_Benefits/).

ACG will operate with 1 week sprints. By keeping sprints at a single week, it allows for adjusting to changing priorities.

## Tools and Process

- ACG will be using [Trello](https://trello.com/) to manage issues and plan sprints.
- An issue is considered ready when it is assigned a label of `ready`.
- For projects, an Epic will be created and the project will be broken into smaller units with the aim that an issue can be completed within a week.

## Backlog Refinement

### Backlog Refinement Meeting Expectations

Coming into the backlog refinement meeting, the expectation is that the most important work for ACG will be placed in the Product Backlog and ordered appropriately.

### Backlog Refinement Description

In the Backlog Refinement meeting, all participants will review the issues in the Product Backlog that have not yet been flagged as ready.  The goal will be to ensure that there is enough ready issues in the Product Backlog to take up 3 to 4 weeks worth of sprints.

## Sprint Planning

### Sprint Planning - Meeting Expectations

Going into the Sprint Planning meeting, it is expected that issues have been groomed and are appropriately ordered in the Product Backlog.

### Sprint Planning - Description

In the Sprint Planning meeting, participants will discuss current capacity for the upcoming week.  Based on that, each will determine the amount of tickets they will be able to pick up for the upcoming week long sprint.

## Sprint Review

### Sprint Review Description

The Sprint Review is an opportunity for all participants within the sprint to review the work accomplished in the prior sprint.  The importance of this is to ensure that it is communicated across the organization what is being done.
