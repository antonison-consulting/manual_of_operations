# Managing Accounts

## Usernames

* A username consists of a person's first initial and last name.  In the event there is overlap, a middle initial will be used.
  * An example of this for Alexander Antonison is `aantonison`.
* In the event a person has a hyphenated last name, only the first part of the hyphenated name will be used for shorter usernames.
  * An example of this is Angelina Uno-Antonison will be `auno`

## Passwords

* It is highly recommended that all passwords are randomly generated and managed via [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
* Passwords for all accounts should be cycled every 180 days.

## Two-Factor Authentication

* When Two-Factor Authentication is available for an account, it must be enabled.
