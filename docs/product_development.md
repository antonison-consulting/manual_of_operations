# Product Development

## Overview

Jami, using her industry background and knowledge will act as the Product Owner.  Additionally, she will be working with people in stores to refine product features.

## Technology

### Sketch

We will be using [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) to design the User Interface (UI) of GCS.  The files will be saved and managed out of the [gcs_sketch_design](https://github.com/antonison-consulting/gcs_sketch_design) GitHub repo.

## Process

A Trello card should be created that highlights the changes to be made.  This card should have enough detail in it to give the reviewer enough background as to why the change or addition is being made. To help with prioritization, a Trello card should be given a due date and ordered appropriately in the Product Backlog to determine the timeline for a card to be completed.

When someone wants to make changes to the Sketch design, they will create a branch in the [gcs_sketch_design](https://github.com/antonison-consulting/gcs_sketch_design) repo and will do a Pull Request when their design changes are ready for review.  This Pull Request should have the Trello card link within it so there is a connection between the work being done and reason it is being done.
