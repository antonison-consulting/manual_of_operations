# Product Development

## Overview

Jami, using her industry background and knowledge will act as the product owner.  Additionally, she will be working with people in stores to refine product features.  

## Technology

### Sketch

We will be using [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) to design the User Interface (UI) of GCS.  The files will be saved and managed out of the [gcs_sketch_design](https://github.com/antonison-consulting/gcs_sketch_design) GitHub repo.

## Process

A GitHub project card should be created that highlights the changes to be made.  This card should have enough detail in it to give the reviewer enough background as to why the change or addition is being made.

When Jami wants to make changes to the Sketch design, she will create a branch in the `gcs_sketch_design` repo and will do a Pull Request when her design changes are ready for review.
