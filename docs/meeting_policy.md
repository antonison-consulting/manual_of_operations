# Meeting Policies

## Meeting Guidelines

The main goal for communication is to identify ways to work asynchronously to better suit the remote nature of our development.  However, there are instances where a meeting can be appropriate such as to agree upon a path and for ensuring alignment.  

A meeting should have the following:

* A clear agenda with goals with decisions to be made

Output from a meeting

* A document that captures minutes
* Important decisions that were made
* Any action items from the meeting should result in Trello cards being created to capture the work

## Meeting Frequency

We shall meet each first Saturday of the month to discuss current progress and highlight any needed changes to current working guidelines.
